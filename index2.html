        <h1> Hello World! </h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Grace Silvaroli. I am a grade 10 student at Immaculata, currently in the ICS2O Computer Studies Program.</p>
        <h3> My Passtimes </h3>
        <p> In my pastime I enjoy physical activity/sports, reading, watching shows/movies and spending time with my family.These activities allow me to stay occupied while having a good time.This is why they are among my favourite pastimes in my spare time. 
        </p>
        <h3> My least favourite subject</h3>
        <p> History would probably be my least favourite subject at the moment. In all my previous history classes, we always have had to  memorise dates of major events and notable people's responsibilities. This is an area in which I have never excelled. But, this year, I'm looking forward to history because my teacher said we won't have to learn a million different dates. So, I'm curious to see if my viewpoint will shift! </p>
